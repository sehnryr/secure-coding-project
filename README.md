## Modules

Each module needs to be adequately implemented to pass the learning outcome.

### Module 1 (15 points)

> Use tools OWASP ZAP and Burp Suite to scan your application for
> vulnerabilities. Choose three most significant vulnerabilities, document them,
> fix them and re-scan the application to prove that the vulnerabilities are
> fixed.

### Module 2 (15 points)

> Use SonarQube tool and scan your application for the bugs. Choose three most
> significant bugs, document them, fix them and re-scan the application to prove
> that the bugs are fixed.

### Module 3 (15 points)

> Implement a JWT access and refresh token in your web application and document
> the example of token usage.

### Module 4 (15 points)

> Analyze the SQL injection vulnerability of your application with one of
> available tools online (for example: https://pentest-tools.com/website-vulnerability-scanning/sql-injection-scanner-online),
> document the potential bugs and describe the current way how the application
> protects itâ€™s database from SQL injection attacks.

### Module 5 (15 points)

> Implement an example of serialization (if it does not exist in your
> application) and implement the deserialization protection based on
> whitelisting the classes that can be deserialized.

### Module 6 (13 points)

> Use the best practices in implementing authentication and authorization to
> prevent unauthorized access to confidential data.
